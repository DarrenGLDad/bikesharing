# Summary: 

There's a consistent conclunsion, that males, more specific male-subscribers, are the top customers for this service. One can observe that the trip-durations vary across genders, at any time of the day. An observer can also conclude from the visuals that there is a correlation between trips (start/stop-times) and the 9-5 work schedule; it would be easy to assume that male-subscribers utilize bike sharing services to commute to and from work in NYC, probably to avoid the infamous NYC traffic.
